* Can deselect all to clear your current guess
* Colors can be repeated, all 4 can be of the same color
* Click "Make Selection" once satisfied with guess
* 4 pegs in a box to the right on every row indicates the accuracy of each guess
* Black peg - in the color code, wrong position
* Red peg - in the color code, right position
* Blank peg - not in the color code at all
* Pegs are in no specific order
* If first peg is red, does not automatically mean the 1st color in your guess is in the right position
* It could be any one of your guess components
* User gets 10 guesses max
* The goal is to match every color code component exactly (4 red pegs)
* Have fun!
